        This policy works by defining a whitelist of allowed AppArmor profiles. Pods
        are then inspected at creation and update time, to ensure only approved
        profiles are used. When no AppArmor profile is defined, Kubernetes will
        leave the final choice to the underlying container runtime. This will result
        in using the default AppArmor profile provided by Container Runtime. Because
        of that, the default behaviour of this policy is to accept workloads that do
        not have an AppArmor profile specified.
